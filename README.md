# TSDoc Standard

### Standard but also use TypeScript on JS files wiht jsdoc.

This `standard` configuration understands that you want to use
typescript on `.js` files using `jsdoc` / `tsdoc` syntax.

The `eslint` configuration knows all about `jsdoc` & `typescript`
to give you improved type safety on `.js` files with `jsdoc`
annotations.

## Install

```bash
npm install tsdocstandard
```

## How to ignore files

Add a `tsdocstandard` key like documented for `standard`
https://standardjs.com/#how-do-i-ignore-files

## Rules

Importantly:

 - `jsdoc`
 - `@eslint-typescript`

There's lots of rules. Plus `standard` as well.

## Usage

Literally just like [`standard`](http://ghub.io/standard)
